# Retail Sales Analysis SQL Project

## Project Overview

**Project Title**: Retail Sales Analysis  
**Date**: 2025-03-01  
**Database**: `retail_sales_db`  

This project demonstrates SQL skills typically used by data analysts to explore, clean, and analyze retail sales data. It includes database setup, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and business insights using SQL queries.

---

## Objectives

1. **Set up a retail sales database**: Create and populate a retail sales database.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Identify and handle missing or incorrect values.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understand the dataset through SQL queries.
4. **Business Analysis**: Use SQL to generate insights about customer behavior and sales performance.
5. **Performance Optimization**: Improve SQL queries for better efficiency.

## Project Structure

### **1. Database Setup**

```sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS retail_sales_db;
USE retail_sales_db;

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS RETAIL_SALES;
CREATE TABLE RETAIL_SALES (
    transactions_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    sale_date DATE NOT NULL,
    sale_time TIME NOT NULL,
    customer_id INT NOT NULL,
    gender ENUM('Male', 'Female', 'Other') NOT NULL,
    age INT CHECK (age > 0),
    category VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    quantity INT CHECK (quantity > 0),
    price_per_unit DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    cogs DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    total_sale DECIMAL(10,2) GENERATED ALWAYS AS (quantity * price_per_unit) STORED
);
```

- **Auto-increment for `transactions_id`** to ensure uniqueness.
- **`NOT NULL` constraints** to avoid missing data.
- **`ENUM` for `gender`** for consistent values.
- **`CHECK` constraints** to prevent invalid data entries.
- **`DECIMAL(10,2)`** for financial accuracy.
- **Stored column `total_sale`** to dynamically calculate total sales.

### **2. Data Cleaning & Exploration**

#### **Check for Missing Values**
```sql
SELECT * FROM RETAIL_SALES
WHERE customer_id IS NULL OR gender IS NULL OR age IS NULL OR 
      category IS NULL OR quantity IS NULL OR price_per_unit IS NULL OR cogs IS NULL;
```

#### **Fill Missing Age with Median Age**
```sql
SET @median_age = (SELECT age FROM RETAIL_SALES ORDER BY age LIMIT 1 OFFSET (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM RETAIL_SALES WHERE age IS NOT NULL) / 2);
UPDATE RETAIL_SALES SET age = @median_age WHERE age IS NULL;
```


#### **Check Unique Customers and Categories**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS unique_customers FROM RETAIL_SALES;
SELECT DISTINCT category FROM RETAIL_SALES;
```

---

### **3. Sales Analysis & Business Insights**

#### **1. Total Sales by Category**
```sql
SELECT category, SUM(total_sale) AS total_revenue
FROM RETAIL_SALES
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```

#### **2. Monthly Sales Trend (Performance Optimized)**
```sql
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(sale_date, '%Y-%m') AS month, SUM(total_sale) AS monthly_sales
FROM RETAIL_SALES
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
```


#### **3. Best-Selling Month Each Year (Indexed for Speed)**
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_sale_date ON RETAIL_SALES(sale_date);

SELECT year, month, avg_sale
FROM (
    SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) AS year,
           EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sale_date) AS month,
           AVG(total_sale) AS avg_sale,
           RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) ORDER BY AVG(total_sale) DESC) AS rank
    FROM RETAIL_SALES
    GROUP BY 1, 2
) AS sales_ranked
WHERE rank = 1;
```

---

## **Findings & Insights**

- **Customer Demographics**: Sales are distributed across different age groups and categories.
- **High-Value Transactions**: Some sales exceed $1000, indicating premium purchases.
- **Sales Trends**: Certain months and time shifts (morning/evening) show peak sales.
- **Top Customers**: Identifying top buyers helps in targeted marketing.
- **Performance Gains**: Optimized queries and indexing improved efficiency.
